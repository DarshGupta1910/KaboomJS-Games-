Kaboom.js is a JavaScript library that helps you make games fast and fun!!
It simplifies creating scenes, adding layers, creating sprites, dealing with actions and collisions 
adding key events, debugging and so much more. 


Kaboom.js is a JavaScript library that contains many useful features to make simple in-browser games. It has functionality to draw shapes and sprites (the images of characters 
and game elements) to the screen, get user input, play sounds, and more. We'll explore these features and learn how they work by using some of them in our game.

Kaboom.js also makes good use of JavaScript's support for callbacks; instead of writing loops to read in keyboard input and check if game objects have collided (bumped into each 
other), Kaboom.js uses an event model, where it tells us when such an event has occurred. Then we can connect up callback functions that act on these events.

Using Kaboom.js in Replit takes care of all the boilerplate initialisation code, as well as asset loading, so we can concentrate on writing the game logic and making game 
graphics and sound.

Core Concepts :- 
1)Objects - add(), destroy() 
2)Components - pos(), scale(), sprite(), body(), solid(), origin()
3)Events - collides(), keyDown(), keyPress()
4)Level - addLevel()
